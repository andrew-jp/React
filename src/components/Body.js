        <p>
            I'm a recent CS Graduate. I'm interested in all things
            digital. I like web development, high performance computing,
            and video games. This is my webpage that I made using React.
            As you can see it is pretty cool. I'm going to test things out
            and make this a great website.
        </p>

            Outside of work and school, I'm interested in everything outdooors.
            I'm an active climber, cyclist, and backcountry skier.
